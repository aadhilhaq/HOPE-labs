"""Draw the launcher's icon: the HOPE Labs mark, a ring crossed by two strokes.

Run at build time, so no image file has to be kept in the repository:

    python docs/brand/make_icon.py          # writes docs/brand/hopelabs.ico and .png

Pillow is a build-time dependency only; the launcher draws its own header on a Tk canvas and the
page draws its mark in SVG, so neither needs an image at all.
