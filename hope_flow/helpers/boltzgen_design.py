"""Generate binders with BoltzGen, and record what came out.

Run by BoltzGen's own Python (3.12), inside a GPU job, not by the flow's.

Two things about BoltzGen's design spec are easy to get wrong, and both are handled here rather
than left to whoever fills the card in:

  - Hotspots are numbered by POSITION IN THE CHAIN, not by the numbering the structure file uses.
    hPD-L1's own file is numbered from 18, so residue 56 in the file is position 39 to BoltzGen.
    Every other tool in the lab takes the file's own numbering, so the card does too and this
    converts. Getting it wrong does not fail: it designs against a different patch of the surface
    for twelve hours.
  - `total_len` is the length of the WHOLE complex, target included, and it is a resample-until-it
    -fits loop. The binder's own length belongs in its sequence as "70..100", which is what this
    writes; total_len is left out.

The conversion is checked before anything expensive starts: `boltzgen check` writes the spec as a
structure with the binding residues marked, and this reads them back and refuses if they are not
the residues that were asked for.
