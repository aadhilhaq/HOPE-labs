"""The built-in documentation, served at /docs/ by the launcher's own page.

By Aadhil Haq

The layout, the stylesheet and the credit bar come from docskit, which HOPE Labs shares with the
HOPE pipelines, the aptamer pipeline and ADCP docking. This module holds only what is ours: the
sidebar, the colours of this page and the credit line.

A page is an HTML fragment in hope_labs/web/docs/pages/<slug>.html: an <h1>, a lead paragraph,
then sections under <h2>. Screenshots are in hope_labs/web/docs/img/, taken of the running page
by tools/docs_screenshots.py, so they show what the page really looks like. Both live under web/
rather than beside this module because web/ is the folder every build carries into the
executable, so the docs travel with it without a line of their own in the build.

#: Who does the work, for the bar along the bottom. Every tool the launcher starts is named with
#: whoever makes it, and so are the engines inside them: four of the seven tools are not the
#: lab's, and almost none of the science is. It is long, and the bar rolls it rather than cutting
#: it off, because the answer to a credit that does not fit is not to drop the credit.
