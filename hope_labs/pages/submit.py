"""Reading a target, checking a form, and queueing a design run.

By Aadhil Haq

Everything here goes through hope_flow: the target is read by the target card's own driver, the
form is checked by the flow's own check(), and the run is queued by the tool's own driver. A run
queued from this page and a run queued from the canvas are therefore the same run, refused for
the same reasons and landing in the same folder, because there is one piece of code that does it
and this is not a second copy of it.

The page builds a flow of two cards, a target and the tool on it, and queues it card by card the
way hope_flow/run.py does: the target first, so the structure is in the run folder, then the
adapter that carries it across, then the tool. The difference from a flow is only that nobody had
to draw it.

What is here and not in hope_flow is the part a flow cannot do, because a flow is checked on a
laptop where the structure is not: looking inside the target. The chains, whether a hotspot is a
residue that exists, and what the hotspots become once converted are all read off the file, by
the tool's own parser, so what the page shows is what the job will see.
