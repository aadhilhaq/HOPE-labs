"""The settings file on this computer: the sign-in boxes, the installs, the saved flows, and
where the flows that have been queued landed.

One module knows where the file is and how it is written, because three parts of the launcher
read it: the window saves the sign-in boxes into it, the hub reads the installs out of it, and
the canvas keeps its flows there. It is deliberately free of tkinter, so the hub can use it on a
machine with no display.

The file is in the person's own home folder on their own computer. Nothing here is ever written
on the cluster: a flow is a few hundred bytes of what was drawn, and it belongs beside the
settings it was drawn with rather than in a quota on Grace.
