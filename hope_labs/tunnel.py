"""Getting from a laptop to a running server on the cluster.

Vendored from HOPE-pipelines' hope_desktop/tunnel.py by way of the HOPE-MD and BindCraft2
launchers. Fix it there and copy it across; the only local changes are the known-hosts file name
and the names in the messages.

One transport serves every tool: the hub signs in once and each tool it starts gets its own
channel on that connection, which is why a person approves Duo once rather than five times.

Four steps, and the reason this is a module rather than a script is that the
awkward one is in the middle:

  1. connect and authenticate, which on Grace means a password and then Duo
  2. start the monitor on the node we landed on
  3. forward a local port to it through the same connection
  4. hand back a URL

Authentication is the part worth being careful about. The site asks for a
password and then a Duo challenge, and the Duo challenge is a free-text prompt
whose wording is decided by Duo and changes: it may offer a numbered menu, it
may ask for a passcode, it may say an approval has already been sent. So
nothing here tries to recognise or answer it. Every prompt the server sends is
passed to the caller with its text intact, and whatever the caller returns goes
back unaltered. The caller shows the text to the person sitting there.

No password is ever written down. It exists as an argument to a callback and
is not stored, logged, cached or offered back on the next connection, because
the only way to be sure a credential file cannot leak is not to have one.
